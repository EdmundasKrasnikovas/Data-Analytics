# AdventureWorks Data Analytics Task

<p>
<strong>Task description</strong><br>
In this spreadsheet you have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>AdventureWorks.salesorderheader (with salesreasonID)</li>
  <li>AdventureWorks.salesreason</li>
  <li>AdventureWorks.employee (with contact data)</li>
  <li>AdventureWorks.SalesTerritory</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of the redundant columns have been removed here (as opposed to original SQL tables) to improve performance. There still may be redundant columns in the data, it is up to you to choose what to use and what not.
</p>

<p>
You've been tasked to populate the '<strong>Overview</strong>' sheet with analytical insight:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Business would like to see the monthly sales trend.</li>
  <li>They would also like to evaluate online vs non-online orders.</li>
</ol>

<p>It would be nice for business to have an overview of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The delivery performance trend (orderdate & Shipdate lag)</li>
  <li>Top salesperson by sales, by volume.</li>
  <li>Top countries.</li>
  <li>Top sales reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>
